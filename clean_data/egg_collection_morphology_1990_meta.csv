Data description: ,,,
"In 1990, several studies of sage grouse eggs and chicks were performed. In those studies, eggs were collected from nests on leks in Wyoming (or the Red Butte captive flock) and brought back to the lab for observation (egg_collection_morphology_1990.csv). Associated nest searching and followup visits were documented (egg_nest_search_followup.csv). Some eggs hatched, and were entered into a study of chick morphology along with chicks sourced from the wild, where their measurements and health were documented until they passed away or were moved onto the Red Butte lek (chick_hatch_morphology_1990.csv).
