lek,Character string,Lek in which individual was observed strutting. ,Sybille Springs lek is now known as Roundtop lek. 
age,Character string,"Age of grouse; either juvenile (<=1 year old), or adult (>1 year old). Juveniles separated from adults by morphology (different colouration, small air sacs) and behaviour (clumsiness, inadeptness at strutting). ",
