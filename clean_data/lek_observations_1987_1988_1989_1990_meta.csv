Data description: ,,,
"From 1987-1990, greater sage-grouse leks were visited by graduate students, professors, and volunteers to survey for bird abundance, lekking behaviour, and strutting and copulation behaviour. Included in this dataset are observations of lek conditions on the day of surveying (weather, ground condition, observers, sunrise time), counts of males and females on lek, and other comments on lek condition.
