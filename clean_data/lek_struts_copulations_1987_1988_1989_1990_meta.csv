Data description: ,,,
"From 1987-1990, greater sage-grouse leks were visited by graduate students, professors, and volunteers to survey for bird abundance, lekking behaviour, and strutting and copulation behaviour. Included in this dataset are observations of lek conditions on the day of surveying (weather, ground condition, observers, sunrise time), strutting behaviour (counts of struts, fights, individual ID) and copulation time and numbers. These data are sourced from two locations: physical binders, and floppy disks organized by Patricia Deibert (nee White). Where the information in each row is sourced from is indicated in the ""source"" column. ",,,

Column name,Values and units,Description,Notes
source,Character string,"Where the data in each row was sourced from: the physical binders (binder), a floppy disk (floppy), or the merging of both records in the case of duplicate records (binder, floppy). ","Though the floppy disks should have been duplicates of binder records, a small number did not find a match due to typos, disagreements in records, or potentially being new records after binder recordings.

type,"Character string, strut or copulation",Indicates whether row corresponds to strutting or copulation,
left_tag_colour,Character,"Patagial tag colour found on the left wing of the grouse. Letter corresponds to colour of tag. Within leks, no two grouse should have the same colour combination. Colours: G = green, R = red, Y = yellow, W = white, O = orange, B = blue. May also be found in combination with each other on tags.  ","If mismatch between binder and floppy, values taken from floppy. Unmarked individuals labelled as ""unmarked"" in left tag color. If color not indicated, the tag may not have been visible. "
