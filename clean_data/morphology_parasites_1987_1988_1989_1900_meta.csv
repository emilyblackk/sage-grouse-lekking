Data description: ,,,
"From 1987-1990, greater sage-grouse leks were visited by graduate students, professors, and volunteers to survey for bird abundance, lekking behaviour, and strutting and copulation behaviour. Included in this dataset is grouse capture and laboratory followup data detailing the morphology (body size, sex, age, etc.) and parasitology (malaria, lice, hematomas, coccidia, etc.) of captured individuals. Fecal, blood, cecal and ectoparasite samples were obtained and brought back to the lab for analysis (though not all samples were taken for all individuals and years). Tag identifiers of these birds can be cross-referenced with strutting and copulations to investigate the effect of parasites on strutting and mating success. ",,,
