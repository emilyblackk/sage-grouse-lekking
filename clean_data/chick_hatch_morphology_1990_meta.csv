Data description: ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In 1990, several studies of sage grouse eggs and chicks were performed. In those studies, eggs were collected from nests on leks in Wyoming (or the Red Butte captive flock) and brought back to the lab for observation (egg_collection_morphology_1990.csv). Associated nest searching and followup visits were documented (egg_nest_search_followup.csv). Some eggs hatched, and were entered into a study of chick morphology along with chicks sourced from the wild, where their measurements and health were documented until they passed away or were moved onto the Red Butte lek (chick_hatch_morphology_1990.csv).

Column name,Data type and units,Description,Notes ,,,,,,,,,,,,
lek_name,Character,Name of lek chick was sourced from. Individual may have been collected as an egg or as live chick - see notes for more information. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
egg_number,Character,"If chick was sourced from egg, unique identifier of eggs. Matches identifiers of eggs in egg_morphology. ","SS3 clutch all hatched at a similar time, and thus cannot clearly tell which egg corresponds to which chick. See notes in data for more information. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
year_pip,"Numerical, year ","Year in which chick ""pipped"" (chick has cut through shell, but has not fully hatched). ",Data only includes the year 1990. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
month_pip,"Numerical, month","Month in which chick ""pipped"" (chick has cut through shell, but has not fully hatched). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
day_pip,"Numerical, day","Day in which chick ""pipped"" (chick has cut through shell, but has not fully hatched). ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
intial_band_leg,Character,Leg (left or right) on which initial leg band with chick identifier was placed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
intial_band_number,Character,Unique identifier found on first chick leg band. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second_band_leg,Character,Leg (left or right) on which second leg band was placed. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
second_band_number,Character,Unique identifier found on second chick leg band. ,"If sorting chick records by identifier, this tag was found on the most number of individuals. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
WYGF_leg_band_number,Numerical,Unique identifier found on chick leg band. Assigned in association with banding performed by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. ,Most often found on individuals who survived long enough to be released into wild. ,,,,,,,,,,,,
year_death,"Numerical, year ","If chick died, year of its death. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
month_death,"Numerical, month","If chick died, month of its death. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
day_death,"Numerical, day","If chick died, day of its death. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,
cause_death,Character,Cause of chick death (if known). ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
observation_num,Categorical,Multiple observations of chick morphology were taken at varying date intervals. This value corresponds to order of observations taken (e.g. a value of 2 indicates this is the second observation of the chick). Morphology recorded immediately at hatch is labelled with a value of 0. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
year,"Numerical, year ",Year of chick observation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
month,"Numerical, month",Month of chick observation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
day,"Numerical, day",Day of chick observation. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
time24h,"Time, H:M, 24H",Time of chick observation for observations. Hatch time indicated by time when observation_num equals zero. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
days_after_hatch,Numerical,Exact number of days after hatch date for which chick observation was collected. Only indicated for individuals which hatched in the lab where an exact hatch date could be recorded. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
approx_days_after_hatch,Numerical,"For chicks collected from the field, an exact hatch date was not known. Approximate days after hatch when chick was captured was noted in notes column. Days after hatch values were calculated from this value for each chick from the field.  ",Individuals for which a range of possible days after hatch were recorded (e.g. between 12-14 days old) were assigned the average of the age range (e.g. 12-14 became 13). ,,,,,,,,,,,,
weight_g,"Numerical, grams",Weight of the chick in grams. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
total_length_mm,"Numerical, millimeters",Total length of the chick in milimeters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
wing_length_mm,"Numerical, millimeteres",Length of chick wing in milimeters. Only one wing (left or right) measured. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tarsus_length_mm,"Numerical, millimeters",Length of chick tarsus in milimeters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
toe_length_mm,"Numerical, millimeters",Length of chick toe in milimeters. ,"One toe length from field notes was given a value of 722 - this is clearly an outlier, and was replaced with NA in the dataset. Observation in which this occurred is indicated in notes. ",,,,,,,,,,,,
bill_length_mm,"Numerical, millimeters",Length of bill in milimeters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
bill_depth_mm,"Numerical, millimeters",Length of bill depth in milimeters. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
prim_num,Numerical,Number of primary feathers on chick. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,
notes,Character,"General notes regarding chick condition, capture, observer, age, progress, and release.",Words which were difficult to read are indicated with a (?). ,,,,,,,,,,,,
